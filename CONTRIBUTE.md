# How to contribute?
- 1. Fork this repo and create a new branch, (e.g. `my-improvement-01`)
- 2. In that branch make some changes, when adding new config, look at the ðŸ”— section bellow
- 3. Make sure to save everything (still in the new branch) 
- 4. Now on YOUR fork of this repo's main page there should be some green `Create a pull request` button, click on that and make sure inside commits tab everything is ok
- 5. Then just confirm everything and make the pull request work
- 6. **Congratulations! You just made a pull request**, now just wait till it gets accepted (*or rejected*)

### Adding new config
- 1. In tabliss, export your config by clicking on the blue `export` in settings
- 2. Create a file inside `files/` forder named like `<name>.json`, for example `super_minimal.json` with the exported tabliss config
- 3. Then inside `README.md` add screenshot with a preview and bellow add name of the config you created, eg. `super_minimal.json`
- 4. Make sure the screenshot preview label has a *italic style* and starts with `- `, so it will be something like `- *<name>.json*` (*of course without the `<` & `>`*)
- 5. *Of course then save everything*
